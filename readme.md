# Learn Anything

> App to share what you know or want to learn next. Together with ideas you want to build.

Built on top of [Solid Start](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start).

Using [Grafbase](https://grafbase.com) for backend.

Code structure is:

```
grafbase
 ├─ schema.graphql -- data model
app -- (Solid Start)
```

## Develop

```
cd app
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

TODO: better instructions

this is still early project.

Explanation of vision and future [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/ideas/learn-anything).

Website is to be deployed on: https://learn-anything.xyz

The version that is running in production now is old, from 2017.

Code here: https://github.com/learn-anything/2017-release

It has nice maps and 2000+ custom curated mind maps. Will be ported to LA eventually.

This current new vision of LA has been attempted to be written multiple times.

- In Next: https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/try/tree/main/archive/la-next
- In Solid Created JD App: https://github.com/learn-anything/solid

This is new one. As minimal as possible. Understandable and documented code.
