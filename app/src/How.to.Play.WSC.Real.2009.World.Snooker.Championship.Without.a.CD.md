## Step 2: Apply the Patch

However, please note that some antivirus programs might detect the patched game executable as a virus or malware, because it has been modified by an unknown source. This is a false positive, and you can safely ignore it or add an exception for it in your antivirus settings. Alternatively, you can restore your original game executable by running the "RU-WCSND.EXE" file again
